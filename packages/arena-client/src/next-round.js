 *
 * A new round starts every 90 s and every run of a round starts together at its start_time; a run lasts at most
 * 82 s, so it ends at least 8 s before the next start. The result card stands for those 8 seconds, and then the page
 * says exactly "joining next round in N seconds" beside a button exactly "exit game", until the next start.
 * Continuing is the default: while round i is on the road the page enters round i+1, so the next run starts with
 * everybody at start_time(i+1). "exit game" stops that; a stake a paying round already locked refunds by the lock's
 * own expiry (§23.1) - there is no other refund. Every network, free and paying.
 *
 * This is the rule; the page (index.html) asks it and draws the answer.
