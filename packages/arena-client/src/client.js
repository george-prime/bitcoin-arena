// THE PLAYER'S HALF OF THE PROTOCOL.

// The node is a store. It takes rounds, entries, batches and checkpoints and
// refuses the ones that break a rule, and it does not recompute any of them
// WHILE THE RUN IS ON: a daemon stepping the core alongside the player would
// be a second simulator, two engines each with its own idea of the present,
// and nothing to say which one is the game.
//
// So the state hash of a LIVE run has to come from HERE, off the same core the
// player is watching. That is the whole reason this file exists.
//
// After the run is over the node does replay it, in `arena-node/src/replay.js`
// and nowhere else - section 13 makes a result final when five of seven nodes
// agree, and a node that could not replay would be agreeing to whatever it was
// told. That is one simulator run twice over the same inputs, which is the
// only claim determinism ever made; it is not a second engine.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not a simulator and it holds no rule: it never decides
// a score, a crater, a hit or a winner. It reads a hash the core produced,
// wraps it in the protocol's own encoding, signs it, and puts it on a socket.
// Every byte that crosses the wire is written by `arena-protocol` - there is
// no second encoder here, and there must never be one, because a wire format
// with two implementations is a wire format with two answers.
//
// WHAT IS INJECTED, AND WHY. The core and the signing function are handed in
// rather than imported. In a browser the core is the bundle already running in
// the page - the very object the game is drawing from - and the session key
// belongs to the run, not to this module; in a test the core is that same
// bundle loaded through `require`. Importing either here would give this file
// an opinion about which core the player is running, which is the one thing it
// must not have.

   * A BATCH THE NODE WOULD NOT TAKE IS RESYNCED ONCE, AND THEN IT ENDS THE RUN.
   *
   * Measured before this existed: a refusal put the words back at the head of
   * the hold and changed nothing else, so the very next `drain` sent the SAME
   * batch, and a node refusing for a reason that does not go away - "expected
   * tick 4242, got 4300", "the batch does not follow the chain head" - was
   * asked the same question for the rest of the round. The socket stayed up,
   * the player kept driving, `nextTick` never moved again, and every watcher's
   * picture of that truck froze at the last tick that landed. That is the 16:08
   * two-Chrome report: P1 in the field, P2's ghost still at P1's bay, tick
   * stuck at 4241, chip saying play and two players the whole time.
   *
   * So a refusal is treated as what it is - a disagreement about where this
   * run is - and the two numbers that could be wrong are re-read from the node
   * ONCE. `resume` is the same door a reconnect uses and it checks what it is
   * given rather than adopting it. If the next batch is refused after that,
   * the disagreement is not about the numbers and the run ends with the node's
   * own words: a player whose inputs nobody stores is not driving a round, and
   * saying so is the difference between a lost run and a lost run nobody knew
   * about.
